""May this might help with meaning: The news of a minor in line for succession was conveyed back to Benin. The order was summarily issued appointing Gabaro’s uncle, Akinsemoyin, to the throne until the infant heir was old enough for the throne. Thus, Akinsemoyin was crowned the fourth Eleko of Eko. Incidentally but significantly, there is a difference in meaning between the two versions of Akinsemoyin’s name. In the Benin version, Akinshinmoye or Akinseymoyin of this name meant that the older people of the family, being strong and wise even when he was young, should hold office. The Yoruba meaning is Ki Akin se fi owo mu oye na, bravery gladdens me.""",[{'akin': ' - bravery'}],yoruba

Adéwùsì,adé-wùsì,Royalty multiplies/is influential.,"The name Adéwùsì, sometimes, spelt and pronounced 'Adéùsì, is the Family name of a royal stock in Ijebu-Ode in Ogun State, Nigeria. The prefix - 'Ade' - (Crown) confirms that bearers of the name are of royal birth. Adewusi or Adeusi Family in Ijebu-Ode is one of the branches of the larger Gbelegbuwa Ruling House, one of the ruling houses in Ijebu-Ode which produce Awujale - the paramount traditional ruler of Ijebuland in Ogun State. Gbelegbuwa Family ' the royalty that earned glory by his character from home or his source') produced the immediate past Awujale of Ijebuland- Oba Daniel Adesanya. The homestead of the Adewusi Family is Odo-Esa in Iwade Quarters of Ijebu-Ode. Odo-esa hosts the shrine of a diety known as Obinrin-Ojowu (the jealous woman). Ogboroganda whose appellation is Obanta ( the King is outside') was reputed to have on his arrival at Odo-Esa in Ijebu-Ode from Ile-Ife, planted or stuck his mystic staff in the ground which staff grew into a mighty boabao tree and diety which Ijebus appease with dogs. Oral history held that Ogboranganda was a grandson of Olu-Iwa, the progenitor of all Ijebus who led the first wave of migration from Ile-Ife to found Ijebuland...
