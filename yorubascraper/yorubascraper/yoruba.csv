The prefix - 'Ade' - (Crown) confirms that bearers of the name are of royal birth. Adewusi or Adeusi Family in Ijebu-Ode is one of the branches of the larger Gbelegbuwa Ruling House, one of the ruling houses in Ijebu-Ode which produce Awujale - the paramount traditional ruler of Ijebuland in Ogun State. Gbelegbuwa Family ' the royalty that earned glory by his character from home or his source') produced the immediate past Awujale of Ijebuland- Oba Daniel Adesanya. The homestead of the Adewusi Family is Odo-Esa in Iwade Quarters of Ijebu-Ode. Odo-esa hosts the shrine of a diety known as Obinrin-Ojowu (the jealous woman). Ogboroganda whose appellation is Obanta ( the King is outside') was reputed to have on his arrival at Odo-Esa in Ijebu-Ode from Ile-Ife, planted or stuck his mystic staff in the ground which staff grew into a mighty boabao tree and diety which Ijebus appease with dogs. Oral history held that Ogboranganda was a grandson of Olu-Iwa, the progenitor of all Ijebus who led the first wave of migration from Ile-Ife to found Ijebuland...

Incidentally but significantly, there is a difference in meaning between the two versions of Akinsemoyin’s name. In the Benin version, Akinshinmoye or Akinseymoyin of this name meant that the older people of the family, being strong and wise even when he was young, should hold office.

His real name was Kúteré, but because he was a very warlike personality, they added the name Ológun to his name and he became known thenceforth as Ológunkúteré. 

Because he was from Lagos and he lived in Lagos, he became known as Ológun Lékòó or Lóogunléko, which means ""the Warlike one of Lagos"" . 

Since then any warlike person or any particularly rascally person is often referred to as Lóogunléko, after the original Ológun Lékòó, Ológunkúteré, the warlike one of Lagos.""

Ofeicita,fi-èyí-s̩e-ìtàn,"In cuban usage, the meaning they give it is ""witness of the itá."" (Itá is what cuban orisa devotees refer to the divination with 16 cowries shells on the 3rd day of an orisa initiation.) This name is derived from Fèyís̩ìtàn (alternately ""Fèyís̩ètàn""), short for ""Olúfèyís̩ètàn,"" meaning ""The head of the household used this one to make memorable history.""","The name is used among those that practice afrocuban Òrìṣà religion. It is often used as a temporary or long-term title for one that is particularly good at transcribing the divinatory information given to the initiate of a cuban orisa initiation. In the same cuban orisa tradition, it can be chosen through the oracle to be the spiritual name of an orisa initiate. Cuban practitioners consider Òrìs̩à Ò̩s̩un to be the first transcriber of oracular information during òrìsà initiation and hence is the first ""ofeicita."" (witness of the life-reading for an initiate)

In Ò̩yó̩ dialect, Fèyís̩ìtàn is pronounced / rendered ""Fèyísìtàn"" WITHOUT the diacritic under the “s”.",[{'fi': ' - to use'}],yoruba

It is also the title of King of Ifon, an ancient town founded by Oláòṣà Aládìkún who is reputed to be the first son of Ọbàtálá.

Oláòṣà Aládìkún was directed by Ifá to establish his town wherever he found Olu (mushrooms) spread on a tree populated by weaver birds literally translated as ""ibi ti olu fon si"" where mushrooms spread. Thus Olúfọ́n.

""Mushrooms spread"" became synonymous with the King of Ifọ́n who is representative of Ọbàtálá (his progenitor) and the name is interchangeably used for Obàtálá because of his popularity and worship in Ifọ́n.

NOTE: The first Ifọ́n is in Ọ̀ṣun state while another one is in Ose local government of Ondo State. There is also Olúfọ́n of Ṣẹ̀pẹ̀tẹ̀rí and Olúfọ́n of Amọ́jẹ̀ in Oyo state.

Olú,-,1. The head. 2. The prominent one. 3. The lord. 4. God (olúwa) 5. The hero/champion,"This is one of the most common roots of Yorùbá names, perhaps because it has also been modified in modern Christianity to refer to God. Initially, however, the name only referred to the most prominent version of something. e.g. Olú-Ọmọ (a child considered to be the most prominent, most relevant), Olú-Igbó (the lord of the forest), Olú-Ọ́dẹ (the head hunter), Olúòkun (the lord of the seas), Jagunmólú (He who fights to become the champion), etc.

In most modern interpretations, Olú is no longer just an almost nebulous root, it refers to Olúwa, which is Yorùbá's way of referring to the most prominent being, interpreted in modern times to mean Jesus Christ, or God Almighty.

Most old names bearing roots related to lesser deities (Ṣàngó, Ògún, Èṣù, Oṣó, etc) have been modernised to merely read Olú. e.g. Èṣùbíyí becomes Olúbíyí, Ògúnmodìmú becomes Olúmodìmu, Fájuyìgbé become Olújuyìgbé, etc.",[{None: ' - '}],yoruba

Omí Saidé,"omi-sè̩hìn-dè, omi-ṣàn-dé","Among practitioners of Cuban Òrìṣà tradition, Omi Saide is said to mean ""the crown of water."" In actuality, the cuban orisa name Omí Saidé is derived from the Yorùbá name Omísè̩hìndè. It means ""water remained after (as replacement)."" Omi (water) is a prefix used for a number of names for devotees of Yorùbá river deities such as Yemo̩ja, Erinlè̩, etc. The name can suggest a series of abiku or still births where intervention by one of the water deities prevented further child deaths. It can also mean that after a series of only girls that a boy was born at long last. An alternate version of this name is Omísè̩hìndé, meaning ""water has arrived finally."" This suggests that after period of barrenness a baby arrived with the help of a water deity one paid devotion to.","This name is used in the cuban Santería/Lucumí community for initiates of Yemayá (Yemo̩ja in Yorùbá language). Yemayá is a sea goddess among practitioners of cuban orisa tradition, derived from Yemo̩ja that is a prominent river deity among the Yorùbá people.

The nickname, Ògèdèngbé, is said to originate from his unique fighting style which involved lifting enemies up above his head. Due to his short height and therefore low centre of gravity, so he is able to stand firm in battle without falling, as he lifts up his opponents before slamming them hard on the ground. On the battlefront, or after returning from war, his panegyric is rendered as, ""Ògèdèngbé Agbógungbọ́rọ̀, ati kan kan lójú ogun"", meaning, ""Ògèdèngbé who craves war as festivals, walks in majestic strides in the face of war"" Ògèdèngbé would go on to conquer territories across modern day Yorùbá land and into the present day Edo and Delta States. He is known to bequeath a number of children from women offered to him as gift, concubines or spoils of war across Àkókó, Èkìtì, Ondó, Edo and Delta areas. Today, several descendants of Òrìṣaríyìbí across these areas use the last name, Ògèdèngbé, Ògèdègbé or Ọbanlá. Among others, Òrìṣàríyìbí was decorated as Ògèdèngbé; Balógun of Iléshà; Sẹ́ríkí Àjànàkú of Ìjẹ̀shàland; Generalissimo/Commander-in-Chief of the Èkìtì Parapọ̀ Army and The Ọbanlá of Ìjẹ̀shàland.

The phonological characteristic of the second syllable in this name is interesting. The second syllable, on the surface, has a high tone. But on examination, we find that an elision has taken place to replace the last vowel in ""ọdẹ"" with the contiguous high-tonal vowel marking the perfect tense (which has now been deleted). This is why the word for hunter, which otherwise has two mid tones /ọ-dẹ/, can be realised, in the full context of the name, as a mid and a high /ọ-dẹ́.../",[{'ọdẹ': ' - hunter'}],yoruba

""The three branches, Ojorá, Àró and Òdòfin are existing stools in the family. The sons of Alárá Orunji are Olúmókùn, Kúéjì and Fáfolú. Fafolu the 4th Ojorá became extinct owing to the fact that he had no offspring, leaving us with both Olúmókùn and Kúéjì who were 2nd and 3rd Ojorá respectively. Their father was the 1st Ojorá and the progenitor of the Ojorás. Àró and Òdòfin stools were chieftaincies created exclusively for Olúmókùn and kúéjì descendants respectively to work with the Ojorá in the administration of the family estate and the township. Ejímósù, first son of Olúmókùn was the 1st Chief Àró while Àsábá, a grandson of Kúéjì was the 1st Chief Òdòfin. The Ojorá stool has from time immemorial been filled with descendants of Olúmókùn and Kúéjì till this day. This fact is contained in the addendum of Suit 227/1918 of the Supreme Court of Nigeria.
